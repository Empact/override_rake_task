OverrideRakeTask plugin by Eugene Bolshakov, eugene.bolshakov@gmail.com, http://www.taknado.com

This plugin is based on the Matthew Bass's idea described here:
http://matthewbass.com/2007/03/07/overriding-existing-rake-tasks/

The installation script is based on the one found in the app_config plugin
by Daniel Owsianski, http://jarmark.org/projects/app-config/

When using rake with rails it loads the task in the following order:

1. Default rails tasks (like db:migrate)
2. The tasks in your app's lib/tasks directory
3. The tasks in your vendor/plugins directory

This plugin will allow to override rake tasks that were defined earlier. It means that 
you'll be able to override default rails tasks with lib/tasks & plugins tasks and 
override the taksks in lib/tasks with the tasks defined in plugins.

In order to override a task you need to define it as usual, but using "override_task" 
method instead of "task":

namespace :db do
	override_task :migrate do
		...
	end
end

In order to make this work the plugin should be loaded before the tasks and the install script
supplied with the plugin adds a line to load itself to the Rakefile. If it won't be able to 
modify your Rakefile, it will let you know and you'll have to modify it manually.
